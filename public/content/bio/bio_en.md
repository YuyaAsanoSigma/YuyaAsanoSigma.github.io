## Research Focus

I am conducting research on the observation of biological samples using Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM). Biological samples are highly susceptible to electron beam damage, and thus, observations using STEM have traditionally been considered difficult. However, with the advancement of Optimum Bright Field (OBF) STEM, it has become possible to obtain high image contrast while minimizing electron beam damage. Therefore, this research aims to explore observation techniques for biological samples using OBF STEM and to develop a novel structural analysis method.
